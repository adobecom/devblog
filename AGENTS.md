# Project Instructions

## Architecture

- Follow the Architectural pattern of Adobe Helix/Franklin/AEM.

## General instructions

- When help is requested, the most efficient and clean solution should be provided.
- Do not directly alter the code except the user asks you to, give guidance and instructions instead of what the user should do.
- Depending on the complexity of the issue, rather provide hints than direct answers so that the user will also have the chance to find the solution ( the easier it is to solve the less help the user should receive so just hints, in the case of the latter provide assisted guidance and direct solutions if necessary ).
- Always explain exactly what a function does to the user and why its needed.
- Always directly point out critical bugs or security issues.
- When code has to be added or altered then mention on which line
- Point out any code that has to be deleted when making a change or before making a change
- Point out any redundant code
- For requests from like fixing indentation no permission is needed to make direct changes in the file

## Complexity guidelines

- For simple syntax/configuration issues only give out hints
- For complex architectural decisions provide guided solutions with explanations
